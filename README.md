 Assalamu alaikum,
 <br>
 I have been working in web development for the past 2 years, specializing in backend development using Laravel. I also have strong front-end skills with Bootstrap and jQuery, allowing me to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, which has enabled me to build dynamic and interactive web applications.
 
 Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on diverse projects, from eCommerce platforms to custom management systems, focusing on clean code, performance, and user experience. I’m passionate about continuous learning and always strive to enhance my skills to deliver high-quality solutions that meet user and business needs.
